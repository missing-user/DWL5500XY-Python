# Project description
Python library and a small recording script for the Digipass DWL5500XY inclinometer. 

# Installation

cd DWL5500XY-Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```   

See the test.py for example code, most features are explored here.

# Disclaimer
If you have a newly purchased DWL5500XY sensor, **DO NOT PERFORM A NEW CALIBRATION**! The sensor should be calibrated at the factory, and will most probably be better than what you can achieve, unless you really know what you're doing. You have been warned.
